ajuda.p1 = Was this film produced by Universal Pictures?
ajuda.p2 = Where can I get plutonium to energize my Delorean?
ajuda.p3 = Why is it "Back to the future" if they go to the past?
ajuda.p4 = Why does Delorean freeze back from time travel?
ajuda.p5 = Is it possible that time is not linear?
ajuda.r1 = Yesssssss, it was produced by Universal Pictures, one of the largest North American producers.
ajuda.r2 = It seems like a difficult task, but not impossible. The only ways to get plutonium without bureaucratic means is to go to DeepWeb or talk with terrorists. You can ask Doc for help.
ajuda.r3 = Somehow the past was once the future which means that the title is not incorrect but misunderstood. Doc has always aimed to go into the future, but in life things don't go as we want. Fact that applies to Brown.
ajuda.r4 = According to what the film wants to tell us, time travel can slow down the particles, causing water droplets to condense to form small ice crystals in the car.
ajuda.r5 = Yes. In our daily life, we do not see this curvature of space-time, but the things that fall into the black hole cannot escape.

ai.p1 = "Back to the future", in addition to being a cinematographic landmark, made several people of the time contemplate the various technologies beyond time travel. With that, we thought about how artificial intelligence could have an interesting use about this parameter of the universe of the film. 
ai.p2 = What we created was a classification model using a decision tree, with the objective in mind to see in which of the years mentioned in the film (1955, 1985 and 2015) a certain technology would fall. Will this technology be able to predict something well?

sobre.nos = A fresh new start. <br> New discoveries, endless possibilities and the will to do it right, with the best possible quality, regardless the deadline for delivery. <br> So we found each other, got together and started a long path towards knowledge.
sobre.projeto = When we remind ourselves iconic movies that marked a whole generation, Back to the Future is definitely one of them. The concept of time travel, interfering with the events of the past and following up the changes througout the future, to see your own parents young back in the 50´s... All of this can be a little bit confusing, but our website is here to help! You can select the year and character on the screen and know more about all events related to them. <br> That´s not all... There´s still much to explore! We wish you a great journey!
